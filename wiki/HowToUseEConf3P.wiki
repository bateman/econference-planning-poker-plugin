To check whether you are connected, see if the light bulb in the bottom-right corner is enabled and move the mouse over it: the tooltip should display all the connection details.

Don't panic if you don't see anyone in the roster: you have no buddies, and also you cannot add them to the buddy list, so you won't distract yourselves chatting with online buddies during the elicitation :)



== Joining an eConference event ==
This section will show you how to join a Planning Poker meeting when you are either the moderator or a simple participant. 



=== The Moderator point of view ===
You are going to role-play the moderator during the session. Thus you should have received an email with a file (.ecx) in attachment. This file is necessary to create the room and invite the other participants. Go to the File > Econference > Load configuration menu (see Figure  4).

Browse and select the .ecx file wherever you saved it. Press Ok and you will see a small dialog which just shows your name and a checkbox that will ensure that the server will send invitations to all the participants registered in the configuration (Figure  6). Be sure to leave it checked, otherwise you will have to invite each of them manually=  =Press ok and you will see the GUI changing and showing the new perspective for the structured conversation.

=== The participant point of view ===
If you are a participant, that is not so much to do to join the event: Just be sure to connect and wait until you receive an invitation: it will show up as an item in the Events pane. . It is not a problem if the invitation was sent while you were offline. The server will store it for you and send it as soon as you get connected.

The invitations received will be displayed in this pane, and stored until you delete it. When you select an invitation, the details about the event will be show in the lower part of the Events pane.

To join an eConference event, just double-click on the item or press the button circled in the picture below.

== How to participate in an eConference Event ==
This section will briefly show what the views are meant for, and what action each participant can do on them.

Once you have entered the event, you will see the online stakeholders in the Who's on view (see picture below). The blue icon indicates who is the Moderator.

Before the event starts, the Moderator can grant a participant the Scribe or the Voter privilege. This is accomplished by right-clicking the stakeholder and select the 'Grant scribe/voter role' item from the popup menu (see figure below).


http://econference-planning-poker-plugin.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/img/RevokeVoter.PNG

*Figure  7. Who's on list, showing online stakeholders and granting special privileges*   

By default all participants (apart the moderator) have the Voter privilege while the moderator has the scribe privilege. The moderator could also ask the stakeholders who wants to be the scribe. 
Note that the scribe can be changed on the fly and that there can be multiple scribe at the same time.



==== What does being a Scribe mean? ====
If you have been selected as a Scribe, then you will see the refresh icon   in the Decisions Place view enabled now. Thus, when the discussion will take place, you will have to sum-up all the decisions that have been taken about each user story, as it is being discussed. Thus you will edit an ongoing minute of the event. Be sure to press the refresh icon at every significant update, so that to show what you have written to the other stakeholders.

=== The Structured Conversation ===
As soon as you enter the event the eConference is still stopped, but you can freely chat with the participants who are currently online while you wait for the others to join. When everyone is online, the moderator decides that it is time to start the Planning Poker meeting and presses the start button in the Backlog View

This view basically shows the list of the user stories that the stakeholders have to discuss about. This view is read only for all of the participants. Instead the moderator uses it to:

*Start / stop the meeting

->After pressing the start button, the moderator can select the current story from the list. This means that the discussion must be about the current story only.

*Start the estimation process of a story

->Only if the meeting has already started. Clicking on the icon in the right-top corner, a popup is displayed so that the moderator can start estimating the selected story. All the changes are propagate to all the online participants

*Add new item to discuss about

->Clicking on the icon in the right-top corner, a popup is displayed so that the moderator can enter the new story. All the changes are propagate to all the online participants


*Edit a story

->Clicking on the icon in the right-top corner, a popup is displayed so that the moderator can edit the selected story. All the changes are propagate to all the online participants

*Delete a story

->Clicking on the icon in the right-top corner, a popup is displayed so that the moderator can delete the selected story. All the changes are propagate to all the online participants

*Figure  13. Adding a new story*   

  
As soon as the moderator selects the first story in the Backlog, you will see the talk view tab renamed from 'Free talk' into the id of the story. Also, all the previous messages will be hidden, just to show only the newly-entered statements related to the current item (see Figure  14). 

http://econference-planning-poker-plugin.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/img/StartMeeting.png

*Figure  14. Conversation about "Story 1"*  


Suppose you have reached a consensus about the current story, and the Scribe has summed up the decisions taken: It is time to move the another story. The Moderator selects it in the Backlog. All the statements about story 1 are hidden, and the talk view is again clean, ready to list only the statements related to story 2

Yeah, but suppose that during the discussion of the story 2 new facts are came out and this facts have impact with the previous estimated story that now needs to be estimated again? Can we move back??? Sure, you can. Furthermore, as soon as you move back to a story that has been previously estimated, all the messages already sent will appear in the talk view again The dashes indicates the beginning of a new session in the conversation about the Story 1.

The discussion goes on for each single item, until all have been discussed and consensus on them reached. Then the Moderator presses the Stop button and you are back in the free talk view to say Ciao to the stakeholders.



=== Save your logs ===
The event is over. As soon as you try to disconnect, close the perspective or even shut down the application you will be prompted to save both the conversation logs and the Decisions place content (see Figure  19). Be sure to say yes, as you will need them to complete your project RFP.

*Figure  19. Save your logs*




== Troubleshooting ==
=== Accidental disconnections ===
==== As a Moderator: ====
If you get accidentally disconnected and you are the moderator, reconnect and load again the .ecx file. If you see someone disappear from the who's on list, be sure to invite him/her again pressing the icon highlighted in the picture below. Then select the id of the missing stakeholders from the drop-down list.
